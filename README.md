# Trips

My time before this bootcamp were spent working as a virtual assistant to a wide variety of clientele. My favorite part of this job was 
travel coordination. Most of my clients were very travel-heavy people. I always needed a way to make life easier for them by having a place
to host all of their travel booking information. This need is what motivated me to make Trips. 

### Current State
Currently, Trips is ready and functioning for the user. The user is able to add, edit and delete flight, hotel and transportation booking information.
While adding to one of these areas, the user can choose a time and/or date from a pop-up calendar/clock. There are no bugs or missing features.


### API's and Hardware
I have tested this app using a Pixel 2 API 28, Android 9.0. The app is only to be used in vertical orientation for U.S. English with a 
minimum API of 26. 

### External Services
Trips uses google search engine.
