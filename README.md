# Trips

My time before this bootcamp was spent working as a virtual assistant to a wide variety of clientele. My favorite part of this job was 
travel coordination. Most of my clients were very travel-heavy people. I always needed a way to make life easier for them by having a place
to host all of their travel booking information. This need is what motivated me to make Trips. 

### Current State
Currently, Trips is ready and functioning for the user. The user is able to add, edit and delete flight, hotel and transportation booking information.
While adding to one of these areas, the user can choose a time and/or date from a pop-up calendar/clock. There are no bugs or missing featuresl that would limit the user.

### Aesthetic/Cosmetic Improvements 
Date and time picker color changes. The hour and minute hand needs to be darker. and the current date and time when not selected needs
to be darker. 


### API's and Hardware
I have tested this app using a Pixel 2 API 28, Android 9.0. The app is only to be used in vertical orientation for U.S. English with a 
minimum API of 26. 

### External Services and Libraries
Trips uses facebook login. The external libraries used are Facebook and Retrofit. 

### Stretch Goals
* Make sure the cards cannot accept past dates in the date picker. 
* Add extra passengers to the flight card. 
* Update hotel and transpertation images using googles Custom Search Engine API.
* Integrate a flight tracker API to get your current fight status.
